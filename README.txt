Address Book (Phone contact list) Python Command Line Program

This program allows the user to record a contact's name and telephone number.  The user can also choose to 
delete a contact or view a list of saved contacts.

This program incorporates the following:

~Takes the user's input and saves it to a JSON file.
~Uses a dictionary to populate the JSON file with contact data
~A master loop is the main navigation for the program, allowing the user to enter a contact, delete a contact
or view saved contacts.
~The user can break out of the master loop, ending the program.
~3 functions are the core options the user has to choose what they decide to do.


Thanks for testing!


IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT

~An option for the user to update telephone number
~Change the display list option to display the list without dictionary scheme
